# DutyRosterSuite
This is an example project for playing around with Spring MVC, Spring Cloud, Spring Boot, Microservices, etc..

Apart from trying out new technologies, this project actually has a real life purpose: it enables me to import duty rosters from a health care company into a personal Google calendar. The duty roster comes on a monthly base in DOCX format.

At the moment, the following technologies are covered:

- Spring MVC
- Servlet 3.0
- Java Config (no web.xml)
- JSP
- Annotation based form validation
- File Upload
- Custom favicon.ico

What's next?
- New modules using Spring Cloud for configuration services and service discovery (Eureka)
- Integrate the Google Calendar Import module as a microservice
